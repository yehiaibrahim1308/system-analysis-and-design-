# System analysis 


The design platform is conceived to transform the way individuals discover, select, and acquire designs for a myriad of applications, ranging from personalized clothing and accessories to bespoke wall art and digital assets for websites and applications. This platform is meticulously crafted to cater to two primary user roles: Artists/Designers and Buyers.


# Platform workflow 

## Artists/Designers:
  - Design Submission: Artists and designers are empowered to upload and curate an extensive collection of their creative designs on the platform. This functionality enables them to showcase their work to a 
  global audience.
  - Design Availability: Each uploaded design becomes accessible for purchase by buyers, providing artists with a valuable opportunity to monetize their creations and gain visibility in the marketplace.
## Buyers:

  - Design Exploration: Buyers can navigate through a diverse and dynamic catalog of designs available on the platform. The user-friendly interface facilitates an engaging browsing experience.
  - Design Selection: Upon finding a design that aligns with their needs, buyers can specify their preferences regarding how the design should be utilized or printed, whether it be on clothing, bags, wall 
    frames, or for digital use.
  - Transaction Processing: Payments are securely processed through the platform, ensuring a streamlined and efficient transaction process for buyers.
  - Artist Compensation: Following the completion of a purchase, the platform orchestrates the transfer of funds to the artist, ensuring they are fairly compensated for their creative contributions.



# Details 

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) provides a comprehensive visual representation of the database structure and the relationships between various entities within the platform. This diagram serves as a foundational tool for understanding data interactions and supporting the subsequent phases of system design and development.

## DFD
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) visually maps the flow of data through a system, illustrating interactions between processes, data stores, and external entities.

### DFD level-0 
Purpose: Shows the entire system as a single process and its interactions with external entities.

  # Current Status:

The project has successfully reached the conclusion of the analysis phase, which included the comprehensive development of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) up to Level 3. These diagrams provide a robust framework for understanding the data interactions and workflows within the platform.

The next critical phase of the project is the implementation phase. This stage will focus on the construction of a fully functional website based on the meticulously designed database blueprint. It will involve the integration of the database with a user-centric interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. This phase is pivotal in translating the conceptual design into a tangible, operational platform that adheres to the established requirements and provides a high-quality experience for both artists and buyers.
